# ToyRobot

Hi there!

Welcome to my implementation of the Toy Robot exercise!
It's very simple and right now only takes commands in the form of a file used with an executable.

Eventually I'll expand it to take commands using `gets` but for now this will do.

## Installation

Feel free to clone the repo, fork it, or do whatever.

## Usage

Please feel free to run any of the tests as they all pass successfully. If you'd like to try the robot yourself you may add the relative command to your bash profile using `chmod 755 exe/toy_robot.rb` and then running `exe/toy_robot.rb` with the appropriate text file. You may also use the fixture which is in the spec folder.
